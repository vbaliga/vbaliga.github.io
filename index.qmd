## Welcome

I am an Assistant Professor of Teaching in the Department of Zoology at UBC.

In the recent past, I was a scientist (also at UBC) whose work focused on animal
locomotion, vision, and evolutionary biology. My research asked how
musculoskeletal and visual systems allow animals to control complex motion. This
means I got to use motion capture and virtual reality to investigate animals'
locomotor behaviors, and examine anatomy & physiology to understand how these
behaviors are made possible.

Data from behavioral or physiological studies tend to be extremely noisy. Making
sense of information in these diverse data sets makes me appreciate statistical
methods and the design of effective visualizations. One of my favorite things to
do is work with people through these types of problems, which inspired me to
teach data science and biostatistics to undergrads at UBC.

I am now actively involved in teaching [BIOL
300](https://biologyprogram-2023.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2019/08/Syllabus_BIOL300_2019.pdf):
Fundamentals of Biostatistics regularly at UBC. Future teaching efforts may
relate to [DSCI
100](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/sites/default/files/course_outlines/dsci100_outline_2020st2_melissa.pdf).
