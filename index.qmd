## Welcome

I am an Assistant Professor of Teaching in the Department of Zoology at UBC,
with a special focus on Biostatistics and Data Science.

In the recent past, I was a scientist (also at UBC) whose work focused on animal
locomotion, vision, and evolutionary biology. My research asked how
musculoskeletal and visual systems allow animals to control complex motion. This
means that I used motion capture and virtual reality to investigate animals'
locomotor behaviors, and examined the evolution of anatomy & physiology to
understand mechanisms and limitations.

Data from behavioral or physiological studies tend to be extremely noisy. Making
sense of information in these diverse data sets made me appreciate statistical
methods and the design of effective visualizations. My passion for discussing
and teaching statistics developed organically as I steadily embraced the
analytical aspects of my job and sought opportunities to teach. I realized one
of my favorite things to do is to work with people through these types of
problems.

As an Assistant Professor, I now teach and/or coordinate [BIOL
300](https://biologyprogram-2023.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2019/08/Syllabus_BIOL300_2019.pdf):
Fundamentals of Biostatistics regularly at UBC. Future teaching efforts may
relate to [DSCI
100](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/sites/default/files/course_outlines/dsci100_outline_2020st2_melissa.pdf)
or courses that blend biology, statistics, and data science.
