## Software packages

### [avinertia](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AvInertia/index.html): Calculate the inertial properties of a flying bird

*avinertia* provides tools to compute the center of gravity and moment
of inertia tensor of any flying bird. The tools function by modeling a
bird as a composite structure of simple geometric objects. This requires
detailed morphological measurements of bird specimens although those
obtained for the associated paper have been included in the package for
use. Written with [Christina A. Harvey](https://www.christinaharvey.ca/)
and [Jasmin C.M.
Wong](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/jasmin-wong).

### [pathviewr](https://github.com/ropensci/pathviewr): Tools to import, clean, and visualize animal movement data in R

![](/images/pathviewrhex_600dpi_trns.png){fig-alt="pathviewr r package"
style="float:left;" width="100"}

Part of the rOpenSci project (github:
[ropensci/pathviewr](https://github.com/ropensci/pathviewr))

*pathviewr* offers tools to import, clean, and visualize movement data,
particularly from motion capture systems such from [Optitrack's
Motive](https://optitrack.com/products/motive/), the [Straw Lab's
Flydra](https://github.com/strawlab/flydra), or from other sources. We
provide functions to remove artifacts, standardize tunnel position and
tunnel axes, select a region of interest, isolate specific trajectories,
fill gaps in trajectory data, and calculate 3D and per-axis velocity.
For experiments of visual guidance, we also provide functions that use
subject position to estimate perception of visual stimuli. Written with
[Melissa S. Armstrong](https://melissasarmstrong.com/) and [Eric R.
Press](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/campus-community/meet-our-students/press-eric).

### [gaussplotR](https://github.com/vbaliga/gaussplotR): Fit, predict, and plot 2D Gaussians in R

![](/images/gaussplotR.png){fig-alt="gaussplotR r package"
style="float:left;" width="100"}

gaussplotR provides functions to fit two-dimensional Gaussian functions,
predict values from such functions, and produce plots of predicted data.

Accompanying paper ([Baliga, 2021](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.03074))
in the Journal of Open Source Software

### [workloopR](https://github.com/ropensci/workloopR): Analysis of work loops and other data from muscle physiology experiments in R

![](/images/workloopR_icon_300dpi.png){fig-alt="workloopR r package"
style="float:left;" width="100"}

Part of the [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) project (github:
[ropensci/workloopR](https://github.com/ropensci/workloopR))

workloopR (pronounced "work looper") provides functions for the import,
transformation, and analysis of muscle physiology experiments in R. Over
the course of developing the package, we expanded this goal to also
cover experiments that are often complementary to the work loop
technique. Written with [Shree
Senthivasan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreeram-senthivasan-43b0881bb/).

Accompanying paper ([Baliga and Senthivasan,
2019](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01856)) in the Journal of Open
Source Software

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [genbank_downloadR](https://github.com/vbaliga/genbank_downloadR): Batch downloading of DNA or protein sequences from GenBank

written as a standalone R script rather than as a full-blown package.
Stable releases also [available on
Figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12980189).
