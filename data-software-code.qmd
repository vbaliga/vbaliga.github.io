## R packages

::: indent-block
### [avinertia](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AvInertia/index.html): Calculate the inertial properties of a flying bird

*avinertia* provides tools to compute the center of gravity and moment
of inertia tensor of any flying bird. The tools function by modeling a
bird as a composite structure of simple geometric objects. This requires
detailed morphological measurements of bird specimens although those
obtained for the associated paper have been included in the package for
use. Written with Christina A. Harvey and Jasmin C.M. Wong.

2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04477-8)) in *Nature*.

### [pathviewr](https://github.com/ropensci/pathviewr): Tools to import, clean, and visualize animal movement data in R

![](/images/pathviewrhex_600dpi_trns.png){fig-alt="pathviewr r package"
style="float:left;" width="100"}

Part of the rOpenSci project (github:
[ropensci/pathviewr](https://github.com/ropensci/pathviewr))

*pathviewr* offers tools to import, clean, and visualize movement data,
particularly from motion capture systems such from [Optitrack's
Motive](https://optitrack.com/products/motive/), the [Straw Lab's
Flydra](https://github.com/strawlab/flydra), or from other sources. We
provide functions to remove artifacts, standardize tunnel position and
tunnel axes, select a region of interest, isolate specific trajectories,
fill gaps in trajectory data, and calculate 3D and per-axis velocity.
For experiments of visual guidance, we also provide functions that use
subject position to estimate perception of visual stimuli. Written with
Melissa S. Armstrong and Eric R. Press.

### [gaussplotR](https://github.com/vbaliga/gaussplotR): Fit, predict, and plot 2D Gaussians in R

![](/images/gaussplotR.png){fig-alt="gaussplotR r package"
style="float:left;" width="100"}

*gaussplotR* provides functions to fit two-dimensional Gaussian
functions, predict values from such functions, and produce plots of
predicted data.

Fitting is achieved via `stats::nls()` to find the best-fitting
parameters of a 2D-Gaussian fit. Prediction can then be achieved over a
supplied grid of X- and Y-values. Plotting can then be achieved in a
`ggplot2`-friendly way, but other plotting frameworks such as
`lattice::levelplot()` can also be used. A 3D plot can also be produced
via `rgl`.

in the *Journal of Open Source Software*.

### [workloopR](https://github.com/ropensci/workloopR): Analysis of work loops and other data from muscle physiology experiments in R

![](/images/workloopR_icon_300dpi.png){fig-alt="workloopR r package"
style="float:left;" width="100"}

Part of the [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) project (github:
[ropensci/workloopR](https://github.com/ropensci/workloopR))

*workloopR* (pronounced "work looper") provides functions for the
import, transformation, and analysis of muscle physiology experiments in
R. Over the course of developing the package, we expanded this goal to
also cover experiments that are often complementary to the work loop
technique. Written with Shree Senthivasan.

2019](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01856)) in the *Journal of Open
Source Software*.

### [genbank_downloadR](https://github.com/vbaliga/genbank_downloadR): Batch downloading of DNA or protein sequences from GenBank

Written as a standalone R script rather than as a full-blown package.
Stable releases also [available on
Figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12980189).

## Tutorials

::: indent-block
### [Multi-panel plots with R](https://flightlab.github.io/MultiPanelPlotsWithR)

Developed for BIOL 548L (Visual and Oral Presentations), graduate course
at UBC. Learning objectives include:

-   Determining how to import & wrangle data from diverse sources.

-   Using the grammar of graphics to construct plots in `ggplot2`.

-   Planning a sequence of plots that support a declarative statement of
    a result.

-   Constructing multi-panel, publication-quality figures using code.
